# Case study: Using telemetry in microservices

An example of using telemetry in a system built on microservices-based architecture.

The system contains out of 5 services:
- **proxy**: serves as a proxy
- **contacts**: takes care about user's contacts
- **messages**: used for sending messages
- **updates**: used for handling updates
- **users**: takes care of users

Each service contains its own `README.md` along with specification and instructions how to run it.
